# bank-app
<h1>I made Basic Bank App with Python. I used API for exchange the money.</h1>
<p>I used that API https://exchangerate.host/#/</p>
<hr>
<p>In this app first you must give your name to class. After that, class auto creates a account (acc number) for you. Your default balance is 0. You can deposit , withdraw , print your infos and exchange dollar to try. My app does not have database for now. I will add soon..</p>
